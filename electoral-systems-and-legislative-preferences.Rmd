name:why-pq

#### Legislaive activities such as .ul.hi-grey[_legislative votings_], .ul.hi-grey[_debates_] (*e.g, ParSpeech V2*) and .ul.hi-grey[_parliamentary questions_] (*e.g, LACAN*) play a significant role in most democracies. 


> __Roll Calls__: Legislative votings are generally dominent by party 

> + .grey-light.it[Slapin et. al (2018): Politicians grandstand strategically against party in the British Parliament]

> + .grey-light.it[Park (2021): in US House committee Hearings]


> __Debates__: MPs are not equally access to floor speech


#### The advantages of using the PQs: 

> .ul.hi-grey[_comprehensive_], .ul.hi-grey[_accessible_], and .ul.hi-grey[_rich_] 


> The party leadership have less control over MP's motivation to employ parliamentary questions .grey-light.it[(Shane 2011)].

> Parliamentary questions may reveal MPs' interests in policy preference .grey-light[(Shane 2011; Saalfeld 2011)].

&nbsp;

#### MPs ask questions for several reasons:

> + Because of their .hi-grey[expertise] or domain responsibility of delegation for question topics.


> + Personal preference such as their nature of .hi-grey[substantive representation] .grey-light.it[(Russo 2021; Saalfeld 2011; Martin 2011)]


> + Electoral motivation: .hi-grey[personal reputation] .grey-light[(Martin 2011)]

&nbsp;&nbsp;

#### Theoretical Expectation:


<!-- > + This was thought to intensify majority-seeking parties to run more than one candidate in a district, which increases incentives for candidates to run on personal votes against their party reputation .grey-light[(Cox 1990; Carey and Shugart 1995)].  -->

<!-- > + Under SNTV, co-partisan candidates cannot rely exclusively on their party reputation and have to find an alternative means of attracting votes by .hi-grey[running on a personal reputation] via .hi-grey[providing paricularistic services] .grey-light[(Cain, Ferejohn, and Fiorina 1987; Reed 1994; Carey and Shugart 1995)]. -->


> + Main Hypothesis: _Legislators elected under candidate-centered electoral systems (SNTV-MMD) are more likely to submit geographically targeted questions than those elected under party-centered systems (SMD)._

# .tiny[Methodology]

name:research-design


#### Model-Finetuning:

> + Used existing labeled pork-barrel legislation as training data

> + Fine-tuned three major transformer models for Chinese classification tasks to identify

> + pork-barrel features in parliamentary questions across time periods

#### Validation with Keyness Analysis:

> + Conducted post-hoc evaluation using QTA techniques

> + Validated results using development set

####  Regression Analysis:

> + Performed regression analyses to test hypotheses

> +  Controlled for legislator and municipality fixed effects across years

#### Pork Barrel Legislation Corpus:

> - Typical pork-barrel policies (or legislation) mainly incur distributed costs while generating parochial benefits for .ul.hi-grey[_specific regions_] or .ul.hi-grey[_designated population groups_].


```{r echo = F, out.width = "55%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/pork-example.png")
```


> - This dataset was cross-coded by three social science researchers to perform its validity, which achieves 99% in terms of consistency and preciseness among coders .grey-light[(Luor and Hsieh 2008; Luor and Liao 2009)].

# .tiny[Takeaway]
---

#### Takeaway

- Evidence exists to show that legislators under SNTV are more likely to ask pork-barrel projects in the questions. 

- While initially reducing legislators’ incentives for geographically targeted benefits, this constraining effect gradually
diminishes and even reverses during election years.

#### The Limitation:

>  __Training Data Limitation__: The training data for pork barrel legislation classification used in this paper covers a period of nearly ten years. However, the models might have limitations in capturing new concepts and patterns that emerged in the post-reform period. 


> The steady decrease in the total number of parliamentary questions (PQs) since 2003 might be attributed to the rise of social media as an alternative channel for constituent communication. -> __Social Media?__
